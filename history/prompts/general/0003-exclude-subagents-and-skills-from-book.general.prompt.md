## Prompt

now i want to  create this book but i dont want one part which is  subagents and skills and resuable just this part i dont want can you help me ? just right dont do anything

## Response snapshot

I understand you want to create a book based on the "Hackathon I_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.txt" content, and you specifically want to exclude the section related to "reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills" (line 22 in the provided text).

I will make sure to omit this part when working on the book creation. I will proceed with generating the book using Docusaurus and deploying it to GitHub Pages, while adhering to all other specified requirements.
