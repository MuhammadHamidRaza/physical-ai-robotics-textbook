## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" has been created.\n\n**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-robotics-book`\n**Plan File Path**: `specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/plan.md`\n\nNext, I will proceed with Phase 0: Outline & Research, which involves creating `research.md` if any "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers were identified in the Technical Context, or if there are specific research tasks needed for dependencies and integrations. However, in this plan, I've filled in the Technical Context with reasonable defaults based on the spec and constitution, so direct research tasks are not immediately apparent.\n\nI will now create the PHR for this plan.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed implementation plan generated for the feature.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with planning phases (data-model, contracts, etc.) or /sp.tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully populated the plan template with detailed technical context and project structure. Noted that direct research tasks are not immediately needed due to clear specification and established defaults.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
